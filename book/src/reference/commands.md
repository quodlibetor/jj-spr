## Commands

### `jj spr init`

Initialize SPR in the current repository. This command prompts for your GitHub Personal Access Token and configures the repository.

**Usage:**
```bash
jj spr init
```

**What it does:**
- Detects GitHub repository from git remotes
- Prompts for GitHub Personal Access Token
- Stores configuration in git config

---

### `jj spr diff`

Create or update a pull request for one or more changes.

**Usage:**
```bash
jj spr diff [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-r, --revision <REV>` - Revision(s) to operate on (default: `@-`)
  - Single revision: `-r @-`, `-r <change-id>`
  - Range: `-r main..@`, `-r a::c`
- `-a, --all` - Create/update PRs for all changes from base to current
- `--base <REV>` - Base revision for `--all` mode (default: trunk)
- `-m, --message <MSG>` - Message for PR update commits
- `--update-message` - Update PR title/description from local commit
- `--draft` - Create PR as draft
- `--cherry-pick` - Create PR as if cherry-picked onto main

**Examples:**
```bash
# Create PR for parent of working copy (default)
jj spr diff

# Create PR for specific change
jj spr diff -r <change-id>

# Create PRs for all changes in range
jj spr diff -r main..@

# Create independent PR
jj spr diff --cherry-pick

# Update PR with new changes and message
jj spr diff -m "Address review comments"
```

---

### `jj spr land`

Land (squash-merge) an approved pull request.

**Usage:**
```bash
jj spr land [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-r, --revision <REV>` - Revision to land (default: `@`)
- `--cherry-pick` - Land PR independently (for use with stacks)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Land PR for parent of working copy
jj spr land -r @-

# Land specific change
jj spr land -r <change-id>

# Land independently (with --cherry-pick)
jj spr land --cherry-pick -r <change-id>
```

**Stacks:** Landing a pull request retargets the pull requests stacked on top of
it at the default branch and deletes the base branches they pointed at, so the
rest of the stack is ready to land without another `jj spr diff`. Until you
rebase and run `jj spr diff` again, though, a retargeted pull request's diff on
GitHub still includes the changes that just landed.

**Important:** After landing, you must manually rebase your working copy:
```bash
jj git fetch
jj rebase -r @ -d main@origin
```

---

### `jj spr list`

List open pull requests and their status.

**Usage:**
```bash
jj spr list
```

**Output includes:**
- PR number and title
- Current state (open, draft, etc.)
- Review status (approved, changes requested, etc.)
- CI status

---

### `jj spr close`

Close a pull request without merging.

**Usage:**
```bash
jj spr close [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-r, --revision <REV>` - Revision whose PR to close (default: `@`)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Close PR for current working copy
jj spr close

# Close PR for specific change
jj spr close -r <change-id>
```

---

### `jj spr amend`

Update local commit message with content from GitHub PR.

**Usage:**
```bash
jj spr amend [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-r, --revision <REV>` - Revision to update (default: `@`)

**Use case:** When PR title/description has been updated on GitHub and you want to sync those changes back to your local commit.

## Revision Syntax

SPR supports Jujutsu's revision syntax:

- `@` - Current working copy
- `@-` - Parent of working copy
- `<change-id>` - Specific change by ID (e.g., `qpvuntsm`)
- `main@origin` - Remote tracking branch
- `main..@` - Range from main to current
- `a::c` - Inclusive range from a to c

See [Jujutsu revset documentation](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/) for more details.
